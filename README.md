# Social Investment Analtical Layer definitions

This repository contains IDI definitions that were developed as part of the Social Investment Analytical Layer (SIAL). As these definitions were not straightforward to use or investigate individually, we extracted these from the SIAL into individual files.

These definitions have not been updated since the release of the SIAL, just extracted for ease of review.
